Work Plan for the Microservices Project

Project Planning

1. Define the requirements for the user authentication and registration microservice.
2. Design the basic architecture of the system (microservices, endpoints, database, etc.).

Development Environment Setup

1. Install Python and necessary tools (Git, Docker, etc.).
2. Create a virtual environment for the project.
3. Initialize a Git repository and configure the .gitignore file.

Microservices API Design

1. Define the necessary HTTP routes and methods (endpoints) for user registration and authentication.
2. Specify the request and response formats.

User Registration Microservice Implementation

1. Create a new microservice with Flask to manage user registration.
2. Implement the necessary routes and logic to:
   - Create new users.
   - Validate input data.
   - Connect to a database to store user data.
3. Create basic unit tests to validate user registration.

User Authentication Microservice Implementation

1. Create a new microservice with Flask for authentication.
2. Implement the necessary routes and logic to:
   - Log in users.
   - Validate credentials.
   - Generate and manage authentication tokens (JWT).
3. Create unit tests to validate user authentication.

Microservices Dockerization

1. Create Dockerfile for each microservice.
2. Build Docker images and test the containers locally.
3. Define a docker-compose configuration to run both microservices together.

Database Configuration

1. Choose an appropriate database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).
2. Configure the database for both microservices.
3. Create the necessary tables and relationships to store user and token data.

Security and Authorization Implementation

1. Implement secure password handling (hashing with bcrypt).
2. Implement user role management (administrator, regular user).
3. Secure the API with HTTPS (if necessary).

Testing and Continuous Integration (CI)

1. Create integration tests to ensure the microservices work together correctly.
2. Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to run tests automatically with each change.

Project Deployment

1. Choose a deployment platform (Heroku, AWS, etc.).
2. Configure and deploy the microservices to production.
3. Monitor and maintain the system.

Documentation and Maintenance

1. Create documentation for developers and end-users.
2. Set up monitoring and alerts to maintain the service.
